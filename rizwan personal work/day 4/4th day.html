<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <ins>dummy text</ins> of the printing and <sub>typesetting industry</sub>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <sup>standard </sup>dummy text ever since the<b> 1500s</b>, when an unknown <strong>printer took a galley </strong>of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <i>five centuries</i>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <em>popularised</em> in the 1960s with the release of <mark>Letraset sheets</mark> containing <small>Lorem Ipsum </small>passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus <del>PageMaker</del> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
